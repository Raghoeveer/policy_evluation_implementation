### Policy Evaluation in OpenAI Gym
This repository contains an implementation of Policy Evaluation using the OpenAI Gym environment. Policy Evaluation is a key concept in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the goal is to compute the value function of a given policy. This implementation focuses on evaluating a deterministic policy in a discrete state environment.
